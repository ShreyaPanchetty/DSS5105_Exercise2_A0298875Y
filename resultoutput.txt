Setup Descriptions

• app.py: This script implements a Flask API exposing two endpoints:
  - `/predict`: Returns predicted stakeholder engagement score based on inputs `W` and `X`.
  - `/ate`: Returns estimated Average Treatment Effect (ATE), p-value, and 95% CI using statsmodels OLS regression.

• Dockerfile: Sets up a containerized Python environment with Flask and necessary libraries. Ensures consistent reproducibility across machines.

• Containerization: Provides a portable and reproducible way to deploy the Flask API using Docker. Helpful for running in GitHub Codespaces and other cloud environments.

Q1.2 – ATE Estimate and Significance

• Estimated α (intercept): 95.9662  
• Estimated τ (treatment effect / ATE): −9.1057  
• Estimated β (effect of spending): 1.5149  
• P-value for τ: 0.000  
• 95% Confidence Interval for τ: [−13.438, −4.773]

Interpretation: The analysis indicates that, on average, corporations that participated in the carbon offset program experienced a 9.11-point lower stakeholder engagement score compared to those that did not, after accounting for differences in sustainability spending. This estimated treatment effect (ATE) is statistically significant, suggesting that the observed reduction is unlikely due to random chance and may reflect a real, negative causal impact of program participation on stakeholder perceptions.

 Q1.3 – Assumptions for Causal Interpretation of τ̂

1. SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption): The engagement score of each corporation is dependent solely on its own participation status. One corporation's treatment does not influence the results of another.
2. Unconfoundedness: The decision to participate in the carbon offset program and stakeholder engagement are not influenced by any hidden variables after accounting for sustainability expenditures. This implies that the observed relationship is not influenced by other unmeasured factors.
3. Overlap: Each corporation had a positive probability of either being in the treatment group (participating) or the control group (not participating). There was no restriction on the treatment status of any corporation.

Q2.3 – Predicted Engagement Score Ŷi

Input:
• Wi = 1  
• Xi = 20  

Prediction via API:
```json
{
  "W": 1.0,
  "X": 20.0,
  "predicted_Yobs": 117.16
}
```

Manual Calculation:
Ŷi = 95.9662 + (−9.1057 × 1) + (1.5149 × 20) = 117.16

Reference Statsmodels Output

• R² = 0.698  
• Adj. R² = 0.662  
• F-statistic = 19.61  
• Prob (F-statistic) = 3.84e-05  
• AIC = 120.2  
• BIC = 123.1
